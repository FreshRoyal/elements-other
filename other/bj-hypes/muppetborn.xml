			<p class="flavor">Fabric? Is that all I am to you? My blood may be colorful and glittery, but I bleed nonetheless. My people have long struggled to be taken seriously, it is why so many of us turn to our faith, our creator: The Hand. It is a force within all of us that guides our actions and speaks through all Muppetborn. The war of my people is far from over, and it will be the bloodiest yet. Waka waka.</p>

			<h4>FUZZY AND WARM</h4>
			<p>A proud and silly race, Muppetborn are chaotic creatures known for innate magical abilities. Born appearing as small balls of cloth, they quickly develop into creatures that resemble humans, animals, and even monsters…but that doesn’t make them evil. Easily spotted by their colorful furs, most Muppetborn who live outside their clans or “Streets” frequently find themselves uninvited from “proper” civilization due to their odd habits. But really, is it a party without a Muppetborn swinging from the chandelier?</p>
			<h4>MUPPETBORN TRAITS</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Constitution and Dexterity increase by one.<br />
				<span class="feature">Age. </span>At birth, they resemble small balls of colorful fabric with googly eyes, but quickly sprout limbs and mature at roughly double the speed of humans. The average Muppetborn lives for 60 to 90 years, however some have lived well past 300.<br />
				<span class="feature">Alignment. </span>Imbued with sporadic energy, Muppetborn often live on the chaotic end of the spectrum.<br />
				<span class="feature">Size. </span>As varied as the thoughts in their heads, the smallest Muppetborn rest just shy of two feet tall while some are large enough to sink even the sturdiest of rowboats.<br />
				<span class="feature">Speed. </span>Your base shuffling speed is 30 feet. <br />
				<span class="feature">Always Obscured. </span>No matter how you look at them, a Muppetborn’s bottom half is always out of view. It’s said that even when one stands in the middle of a field, the earth will rise up to meet them. For this reason, they are always considered to have half cover and receive a permanent +2 bonus to AC.<br />
				<span class="feature">The Hand. </span>Muppetborn mythology speaks of The Hand inside each of them. They innately know the cantrip Mage Hand, however the floating hand can only lift up to five pounds and move up to five feet per character level.<br />
				<span class="feature">Nom Nom Nom. </span>Muppetborn absorb the energy from food without ever having to swallow it. <br />
				<span class="feature">Cloth And Color. </span>All Muppetborn know the cantrip “Mending” and once per long rest it can be used to heal 1d8 hitpoints. This increases to twice per long rest at 5th level, three times at 10th level, four times at 14th level, and five times at 18th level. <br />
				<span class="feature">Languages. </span>You can speak, read, and write Common, Clothing, and Ventrillo.<br />
				<span class="feature">Subraces. </span>Three main subraces of Muppetborn exist: Hand of The Monster, Hand of The Grouch, and Hand of The Animal. Pick one for your character.<br />
