		<description>
			<p>Paladins of the College of Vigilante are in the public's eye by day, while working for an agency or organization by night. These Paladins might simply be famous because who they are, or they may have earned their status because what they've done.</p>
			<h5>TENETS OF THE VIGILANTE</h5>
			<p>The following virtues are common to all paladins, even though the situations and laws might be different on each case:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Justice in Your Hands. </i></b>Sometimes you must step outside the law to exact justice for keeping peace.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hunt. </i></b>Seek out those who might do harm to the innocent, even if they hide.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Eliminate the Guilty. </i></b>The guilty must be destroyed in order for the innocent to live in peace.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hunter of the Evil.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with divine accuracy upon a creature. When you make an attack roll, you can also use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Smite the Guilty.</i></b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the creature can only take an action or bonus action on its next turn.</p>
